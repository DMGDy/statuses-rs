# statuses-rs

## what does it do
Right now it only gets the machines RAM
by reading `/proc/meminfo`. Plan to implement local IPv4 getter.

## why

Most times people implement system status widgets they are lazy and write the tool in a scripting language because
it is easy. Writing such a small tool can be easily done in a compiled language like Rust. This is that.
